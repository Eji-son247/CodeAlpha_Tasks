Network Sniffer Project.

As a Cybersecurity intern at CodeAlpha , I have been tasked with building a Python program to capture network traffic packets, analyze the captured packets to understand their structure and content, learn how data flows through the network and the basics of protocols, and display useful information such as source/destination IPs, protocols, and payloads using the Scapy Python library.

Here's the Overview of My Project:
-Install Scapy on my development environment (VSCode) using:
pip install scapy

-Configure VSCode to run with administrative privileges to allow for packet capturing.

Review the implementation process, identify potential challenges, and make necessary corrections. 

From this project, I learned how data moves through networks, how to use tools like Scapy to analyze network traffic, and it deepened my practical knowledge of network protocols.
