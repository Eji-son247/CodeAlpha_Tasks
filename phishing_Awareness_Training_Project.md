PHISHING AWARENESS TRAINING

As a cybersecurity intern at CodeAlpha, I have been tasked to create a presentation on phishing awareness and educating others about social engineering tactics employed by malicious actors. For the sake of readability and clarity, I will be breaking this down into two parts. 
The first slide will focus on phishing attacks, while the second slide will cover social engineering.

Part 1: Introduction to Phishing. 
Phishing is a cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. They often use deceptive emails, messages, or fake websites to trick users into revealing confidential information.

How to Recognize Phishing Emails and Fake Websites
Signs of a Phishing Email:
- Suspicious sender address: look out for email addresses that donâ€™t match the official domain.
- Sense of urgency or threatening language: Phrases like "Your account will be suspended" or "Immediate action required."
- Unexpected attachments or links: Be cautious of attachments or links from unknown sources.
- Generic greetings: Use of "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
- Spelling and grammar mistakes: Many phishing emails contain grammatical errors.

Identifying Fake Websites:
- Check the URL: Ensure the website address matches the legitimate site. Look for misspellings or extra characters.
- Secure connection: Look for "https://" and a padlock icon in the address bar.
- Design and Content: Fake sites may have poor design or misspelled text.

Best Practices to Avoid Falling Victim
- Verify requests: Always confirm suspicious requests via a separate communication channel.
- Think before clicking: Hover over links to see the real URL before clicking.
- Do not share sensitive information: Never send passwords or personal info through email or social media.
- Use strong passwords: Create complex passwords and avoid using the same password on different accounts.
- Enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) or used Google password manager.
- Keep software updated: Regularly update your operating system and applications.

Part 2: Social Engineering.
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. It's the mission of a threat actor acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Social Engineering Tactics Used by Malicious Actors 
- Impersonation: Pretending to be someone trustworthy, such as a family member, friend, boss in the office or IT support.
- Smishing (SMS phishing): Sending deceptive text messages to lure victims into revealing information or clicking malicious links.
- Vishing: Voice phishing via phone calls.
- Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. 
- Social media exploitation: Gathering of information from social media profiles to craft convincing attacks.

How to Recognize Social Engineering Attacks.
- Sense of urgency or threatening language 
- Unsolicited requests for sensitive information 
- Unusual sender email addresses or links 
- Offers that seem too good to be true 
- Request to bypass security procedures 

Best Practices to Protect Against Social Engineering.
- Verify identities: Always confirm who's contacting you through other communication channels.
- Be cautious about clicking links and attachments: Hover over links to see the URL before clicking.
- Never share passwords or sensitive info: No legitimate organization asks for passwords via email or social media.
- Enable Two Factor Authentication or use Google password manager to add an extra layer security.
- Always report suspicious activities 
- Always keep your software or application updated.

In conclusion, social engineering is a serious threat that relies on human trust, stays vigilant, always verifies requests and follows security best practices.
