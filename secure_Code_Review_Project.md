SECURE CODING REVIEW PROJECT.

As a cybersecurity intern at CodeAlpha, I have been assigned a task of selecting a programming language and application to audit, perform a code review to identify security vulnerabilities, provide recommendations and best practices for secure coding, document findings and suggest remediation steps for safer code using tools like static analyzers or manual inspection methods. After careful consideration, I chose Python as the programming language because of its ease of use, security features, and extensive libraries.

Language: Python
Application: A web application handling user login and data storage

Performing a Code Review to Identify Vulnerabilities
Key steps:
ðŸ”¹Review input validation: Check if all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized.
ðŸ”¹Authentication and authorization: Ensure secure password storage (e.g., hashing) and proper session management.
ðŸ”¹Data handling: Look for injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection.
ðŸ”¹Error handling: Ensure errors do not leak sensitive information.
ðŸ”¹Cryptography and data storage: Verify secure use of encryption and key management.
ðŸ”¹Third party libraries: Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

Tools for Analysis
Static Application Security Testing (SAST): 
- Bandit 
- SonarQube
Dependency Scanners: 
- OWASP Dependency Check
- Pip Audit
Manual Inspection:
- Review code logic, especially around security sensitive areas.
Manual Inspection Techniques:
ðŸ”¸ Code walkthrough: Read through the code line by line focusing on security critical sections.
ðŸ”¸Check for common vulnerabilities:
- SQL Injection: Use parameterized queries.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Properly encode outputs.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Implement tokens.
- Insecure Session Management: Implement secure session cookies and timeouts.
ðŸ”¸Review authentication logic: Verify password hashing and multi factor authentication if present.
ðŸ”¸Assess error messages: Ensure they do not reveal system information.

Recommendations and Best Practices:
- Input validation: Always validate and sanitize user inputs.
- Use prepared statements: Prevent SQL injection.
- Secure authentication: Store passwords with strong hashing algorithms and implement account lockouts.
- Encryption: Use HTTPS on port 443 to encrypt sensitive data.
- Session security: Use secure, HTTP only cookies and implement session expiration.
- Regular updates: Keep dependencies and libraries updated.
- Code reviews: Conduct peer reviews regularly.
- Security testing: Integrate automated and manual testing.

Documentation and Remediation Steps:
- Document findings: List vulnerabilities with severity, location, and evidence.
- Prioritize fixes: Focus on high severity issues first (e.g., SQL injection).
- Implement fixes: Apply secure coding practices, update dependencies.
- Retest: After fixes, rerun static analysis and manual reviews.
